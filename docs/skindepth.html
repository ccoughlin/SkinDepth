	<p>SkinDepth is a simple utility to calculate the depth of attenuation, or
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect">skin depth</a>, of an electromagnetic 
	wave inside a conductive material. At the skin depth, a wave drops to around 
	37% its original amplitude, so by 4 times the skin depth the wave is almost 
	completely attenuated (37% of 37% of 37% of 37% or about 98% of the original 
	amplitude). Among other things this is an important number to know for
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference">EMI/RFI</a> 
	shielding, some types of nondestructive testing, and radiofrequency losses in 
	transmission lines and transformers. The skin depth of a conductive material 
	depends on its
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>, 
	its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)">magnetic 
	permeability</a>, and the frequency of the wave.</p>
	<p>SkinDepth uses an approximation to the skin effect calculation - it's valid 
	for metals up to at least the microwave (GHz) range for the most part, but for 
	poor conductors (insulators) it may only be applicable to a few tens of kHz. 
	SkinDepth won't warn you if the frequencies you're using would make this approximation 
	less than accurate so if you need the "real" results consult some of the above 
	links for a more thorough background on the subject.</p>
	<p>The SkinDepth program keeps a database of conductive materials and can automatically 
	calculate the skin depth of a given material for a given frequency (and vice 
	versa). SkinDepth comes with a list of some conductive materials that you can 
	add materials to as you need them. </p>
	<h1><a name="System Requirements">System Requirements</a></h1>
	<p>SkinDepth is written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python 2.7</a> and 
	currently uses the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a> platform for 
	its user interface, so you&#39;ll at least need these two packages installed 
	on your local machine. Disk space and memory requirements are minimal-if you 
	can run (wx)Python you can run SkinDepth. SkinDepth has been tested under Linux 
	(Fedora Core 14 x64), Windows XP, and Windows 7, and should work on any platform 
	with Python 2.7 and wxPython installed.</p>
	<h1><a name="Basic_Usage">Basic Usage</a></h1>
	<p>SkinDepth comes with a basic set of materials to get you started in <tt>somemats.db</tt>. 
	From the File menu select Open Materials File... or press CTRL+O to open a file 
	dialog box from which you can load the file. You can
	<a href="#Adding,_Deleting,_and_Revising_Materials_">add, edit, or delete materials</a> 
	from this file as you like of course. If you&#39;re curious, the file is a standard
	<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database file and can be read and 
	modified by outside applications.</p>
	<h2><a name="Calculating_Skin_Depth">Calculating Skin Depth</a> </h2>
	<p>To calculate the skin depth for a given material, start by selecting a material. 
	Scroll down the list of available materials and highlight (click) on the one 
	you&#39;re interested in. Once you&#39;ve got a material selected, enter the 
	frequency of the wave you&#39;re testing in the Frequency box. SkinDepth defaults 
	to assuming this frequency is expressed in Hertz (Hz); you can also provide 
	frequencies in everything from mHz to GHz by changing the units in the drop-down 
	box next to the Frequency box. You can also use exponential notation in the 
	Frequency box, so 1 kHz can be entered as 1000 Hz, 1 kHz, 1e3 Hz, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>To calculate the skin depth of this frequency in this material, just click 
	the &quot;Calculate Skin Depth&quot; button to get the answer. SkinDepth defaults 
	to reporting this depth in millimeters (mm), but if you&#39;d prefer a different 
	unit you can choose the units first and then click the &quot;Calculate Skin 
	Depth&quot; button. So if you&#39;d like to find the skin depth in inches for 
	1 kHz, change the &#39;m&#39; in the Skin Depth units drop-down box to &#39;inches&#39; 
	and then click &quot;Calculate Skin Depth.&quot; </p>
	<h2><a name="Calculating_Excitation_Frequency_">Calculating Excitation Frequency
	</a></h2>
	<p>In some applications (such as eddy current testing), you have an attenuation 
	depth that you&#39;d like to match to a frequency. SkinDepth lets you calculate 
	an excitation frequency for a known skin depth-just choose a material, enter 
	the skin depth you&#39;re interested in, adjust the units for skin depth and 
	reported frequency to your liking, and click the &quot;Calculate Frequency&quot; 
	button. </p>
	<h2><a name="Adding,_Deleting,_and_Revising_Materials_">Adding, Deleting, and 
	Revising Materials </a></h2>
	<p>To add a new material to the current materials file, select &quot;Add A Material&quot; 
	from the Operations menu, or press CTRL-+ and the Add/Edit Material window will 
	appear. Fill in the fields in this window for your new material and click &quot;OK&quot; 
	to add the material to the file or &quot;Cancel&quot; to cancel. Note that the 
	materials file allows only one entry per material name so be careful when adding 
	new materials-e.g. adding a new material &#39;Aluminum&#39; will overwrite the 
	existing &#39;Aluminum.&#39; Since the material file auto-updates with changes, 
	the old material entry will be gone forever if you add a new material with the 
	same name. </p>
	<p>To delete a material, highlight the material to remove from the list of materials 
	in the current file and select &quot;Remove A Material&quot; from the Operations 
	menu, or press CTRL-- . SkinDepth will ask for confirmation for deletion-click &quot;OK&quot; 
	to remove the selected material. Click &quot;Cancel&quot; to cancel the deletion.
	</p>
	<p>To edit an existing material, select the material to revise from the materials 
	list and double-click the material in the list. The Add/Edit Material window 
	appears, this time with all the data currently in the materials file about the 
	material you selected. Simply revise as necessary and click the &quot;OK&quot; 
	button as before to update the materials file. Note that if you change the material&#39;s 
	name that this revised entry will not overwrite the material you selected but 
	will save the material as a new material under the new name (and possibly overwrite 
	an existing entry with the same name if it already exists).</p>
	<h1><a name="Importing and Exporting">Importing and Exporting</a></h1>
	<p>If you ever find the need to copy a number of new materials into your materials 
	database or you&#39;d like to share materials with another SkinDepth user, SkinDepth 
	has the ability to both import and export entire materials files. The materials 
	files are exported as SQL scripts-ordinary text files that contain a series 
	of commands to SkinDepth&#39;s database to recreate the original. Just select &quot;Export 
	As Text File...&quot; from the File menu to export your current materials file 
	as a SQL script, and &quot;Import Text File...&quot; to import a SQL script 
	into the current database file. Note that materials in the database will be 
	overwritten by materials of the same name in the export file, e.g. if your import 
	file has &quot;Iron&quot; this entry will replace the entry for &quot;Iron&quot; 
	in the database if it already exists.</p>
	<p>SkinDepth can also import materials files directly - just select &quot;Import 
	Materials File...&quot; and browse to the file you'd like to import. Since this 
	import was designed mainly to fetch remote updates (more on that in a second), 
	it doesn't overwrite materials in your current file if it finds two materials 
	with the same name. Instead, it ignores the material in the file to import and 
	keeps the original material entry.</p>
	<p>Finally, this version of SkinDepth can automatically fetch updated materials 
	lists from the website. Just select &quot;Get Updated Materials Database...&quot; 
	from the File menu to have SkinDepth "phone home" for the latest materials entries 
	file. The file will be downloaded from the website, and any materials not in 
	your current materials file will be automatically imported for you.</p>
